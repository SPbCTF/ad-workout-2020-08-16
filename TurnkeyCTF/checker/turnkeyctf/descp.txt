Can you find the flag? Hint You don't need to search for the flag outside the DB, there is more than tables and columns in a DB. 
Can you wait for the answer? Hint Do not wait for it, it is already there :) 
Darn, I found this flag so I put it in flag 1.doc but I can't seem to be able to see it anymore.

Friday is the best day of the week, and so I really want to know how many Fridays there are in file. But, with a twist. I want to know how many Fridays there are one year later than each date. 
I'm almost positive we put a flag in file. Can you find it for me? 
Just put in the password for the flag!

Now, this is an open challenge. h4x0r has created his own encryption algorithm and has decided to challenge all the hackers in the world. He has made the code public .  He challenges you to find the text he has encrypted and promises to reward you handsomely if you manage to do so. To make things simpler he has also given you the hint that the text he has encrypted is only alphanumeric. The text encrypted using the above algorithm is: <pre>168 232 100 162 135 179 112 100 173 206 106 123 106 195 179 157 123 173</pre>  The flag is the MD5 of the decrypted text.  HINT: Sometimes the most direct approach gives the answer
Tags: #Misc Animesh and Ayushi are good friends. Ayushi is good at dancing but Animesh is not. As Felicity is coming, Animesh, keeping his hacking skills aside, is trying to learn a Bollywood dance from Ayushi. As Ayushi knows that Animesh is not good at dancing, she teaches him only easy moves, such as moving forward, backward, right and left. Animesh, after lot of practise is now able dance well with those limited moves, but unfortunately he is unable to get any partner. Animesh asks his friend Aalekh for help, but instead of helping, Aalekh, based on Animesh's dance performance gave him a Jumbo Maze Puzzle hidden with a flag (sign of true friendship :P). Aalekh promises him that if he can extract the flag out of the Maze, he will get a partner for Animesh. As you all would have known Animesh very well till now, he want a dance partner at any cost, hence he asks you for the help to find the flag. Can you help Animesh find his dance partner? Link to Jumbo Maze: here (If the length of answer string exceeds 255, you need to submit the md5sum of the flag)
Tags: #Networking The birthday party of Saumya had already started (without inviting Animesh), but Animesh is not upset regarding this. Instead, he bought a birthday gift for her (obviously with a hidden flag) and thought of gifting it to Saumya. Unfortunately on his way to the venue of birthday party, he accidentally dropped the gift in a heap of sand. The party is going to end very soon and Animesh wish to gift her before the party is over. For that, he is trying very hard to dig every place in search of his gift. Can you help him in finding the lost gift?
Tags: #ReverseEngineering As Aalekh successfully cracked the secret given by Mandy in Simple Secret- Part 1 Mandy comes with a stronger way of hiding the secret. Can you help Aalekh this time? Link to executable: here
Tags: #Web Animesh and Aalekh are very good friends. Animesh always like things working at Ultra fast speed and gave Aalekh a challenging task. He asks Aalekh to complete the task, after the completion of which, Animesh will give Aalekh a Juice Treat. Can you help Aalekh getting a Juice Treat? Challenge link: here
Tags: #Web Unfortunately, Animesh, even after repetitive efforts, could not get the final invitation to his friend Saumya's birthday party. But Animesh did not stop here. He came to know from Anjali (who is attending Saumya's birthday party) that there is a wild card entry in the party, but the key required for that is not known by anyone except Saumya. Now interestingly Saumya had kept the details of people coming to the party in a database. Now Animesh tries his luck for the last time to get the 'wild card key' required for the birthday party. Can you help Animesh in his last attempt? It is known that Saumya usually checks the details of people coming to the party from: here

&lt;div&gt;In today's world, hash collisions are becoming more and more popular. That is why, one must rely on standardized hashing techniques, such as bcrypt. However, n00bster shall never learn, and he has implemented his own hash function which he proudly calls foobar. Attached is an implementation of the hash function and a file with which you are supposed to find a collision. He believes that you will not be able to find a collision for the file, especially since he hasn't even given you the hashing algorithm, but has packaged it as a black box application. Prove to him that he is wrong.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Note: Multiple collisions are possible, but only one of them is a valid flag.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You will realize you've gotten it once you do.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Created by: Jay Hitesh Bosamiya&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We need to know how to decrypt their messages in order to successfully defeat them. Luckily, a friend of mine found one of those encrypted messages:0x1be15dc77676058612030623726760x95420x2546c9ec026146100x3b3154e5a0a923ffHint: uppercase seems legit. 
1. you have 25 bytes, you work on 22 bytes and 3 bytes separately.2. flag format = e(22bytes) + e(3bytes)3. which means d(e(22bytes)) + d(e(3bytes)) must be the same with the binary words. (have you checked this before? ;)4. it's base64, there is a possibility that d(x) == d(y)5. we know you're confused!

Although it seems like The Plague's messaging service is secure, there are bound to be bugs in any 20th century crypto system. We've recovered of the block cipher The Plague implemented. Use their online encryptor tool, at 54.82.75.29:8193, to break the cipher and figure out Plague's secret plans.NOTE: When the service sends you a hex-encoded string, respond with a hex-encoded string.
Although it seems like The Plague's projects are open source, it's not quite so simple to figure out what the source code does. We believe is supposed to print out secret information, but the KEY variable in the Makefile has been lost. Find the key, build the project, get us the information.

Among his hobbies, John likes baking cakes to eat during the warm afternoons in Milan. He is damn good at this such that, a couple of months ago, he decided to open a pastry shop on his own. The shop was an immediate success and John needed to bake just so many cakes that he decided to outsource the production of his famous NewYorkCheeseCake to another external and trusted pastry shop, the Shamano’s (see shamanoPastryShop.pem). John provided Shamano’s with the original basic recipe of his Cake (see Cake.java) and, after his customization, Shamano returns to John a cake container holding the NewYorkCheeseCake (see ShamanoCakeContainerEncoded.jar). Notice that Shamano has to follow John’s directions carefully and that is why he always have to encode properly his cake containers so that John can verify all of them accordingly to a fixed decoding process (see extract of source code in Decode.java). John always tries his best for verifying the quality and genuineness of the incoming NewYorkCheeseCake but, you know, to busy people, like he is, it may sometimes happen to forget to check something… You can find the shop at

As time passes by and the zombie apocalypse seems to stay for a while businesses have to adapt to survive. Food store chains offer brains and biscuits for their limping customers and fox on Fire seems to be a all-time-zombie-favourite, too. Since a lot of zombies have a broad band connection businesses strive to get online stores back up again. It's just that webdesign seems to be quite hard for zombie employees. They obfuscate all their code (god knows why). Here is an example of a miserable attempt to create a working website.
As you play your favourite game "Oktoberfest Slaughter" your worst nightmare comes true: The drunken zombies somehow managed to escape into reality, grap all your precious beer from the fridge and take it back into their virtual party! Now they want you to enter a password to return YOUR beer. But can you trust drunken zombies!?

At the dawn of mars colonization corporate wars were extremely common.Best technologies mankind ever made were turned into thousands of new ways to kill.Every single corporate war were a real bloody hell and 80% of corporate mercenaries were dead in two to three weeks.That's not straight the point of this task. There is a legend being told about engeneering squad sergeant who didn't wanted to just disappear. So, few minutes before he was burnt by napalm strike he was able to attach personal distress beacon to the nearby high power radio-relay tower, record and set some random destination route trom inside the radiorelay network in hope that he who finds message will report srgt's death to HQ.Legend says that beacon is still functional and dead srgt's message is circulating in radio relay network for decades without being noticed.We know the destination net of the message, however land around the destination tower is highly radioactive, so no live being is able to approach. There is a service terminal allowing to connect your equipment to destination tower and one of beacon-facing towers channels via high power radio, with shitty channel quality however. Towers are using ancient and vulnerable as hell routing protocols. We believe that with your skills you'll be able to reroute dead man's message and recover his personal id number thus he wouldn't be forgotten.This personal id is a key for the task. Beacon message destination is 10.x%@.200.0/29.Good luck.HINT: There are some hosts with telnet in your network

But he is not the Square he once was. Years of imprisonment, and the still heavier burden of general incredulity and mockery, have combined with the natural decay of old age to erase from his mind Dmany of the thoughts and notions, and much also of the terminology, which he acquired during his short stay in Spaceland. He has, therefore, requested me to reply in his behalf to two special objections, one of an intellectual, the other of a moral nature.

Bobby has been into Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation lately.One day, he went to an amusement park in his city. It was very famouse for its Roller Coaster Rides.But, Bobby, being 12 years old, was not allowed on those rides, as it was open for people who were 14 years or older.This made Bobby very angry. On reaching home, he hacked into the servers of the amusement park, got hold of the validation software for the Roller Coaster rides, and modified it, so that nobody is allowed to have a ride on those Roller Coasters.validation
Books are a great thing. And since libraries are a big amount of books you can read in one place, they're great, too.But this secret library some guys started is a bit different. You have to know the exact title of a book to get it, you can't look around. So you have to know another person in the library who knows some book titles or you won't be able to read anything. A bit like an invite-only library.This whole thing seems weird. Could you poke around and try to figure out what they're up to? If you could grab one of their books, that would be awesome.connect to

Category: Reverse Points: 100 Solves: 0 Description:We have found this suspect binary in one of the SKY project routers. We suspect that the Club installs this binary to mark the enemy networks intruded by them, and that hidden information exists inside the binary which can be obtained via network. Find which information is that.
Category: Reverse Points: 120 Solves: 1 Description:The Club conducts a rigid and cruel training with their future agents. An exam is applied in which the student needs to stay awaken and concentrated during 72h looking to a computer screen. Everytime an asterisk appears in the screen, he needs to press the RETURN key within one second. The student doesn’t know if he was able to comply with the reaction time required by the exam until the end of those 72h, increasing his anxiety and psychological pressure level. Elapsed the 72h, the student receives an approval flag if he succeeded. Otherwise, all of its vital life is absorbed by the Club leaders, producing an slow and painful death.
Category: Reverse Points: 600 Solves: 0 Description:In order to protect their maximum security facilities, the Club employs an electronic security lock activated by a 256-bit key which changes every minute. When a Club member is authorized to enter some of these facilities, he receives this key in hexadecimal format, the same format which is used to enter the key in the electronic lock’s keyboard. The last year (in 2015), Project SKY intercepted a key valid for April 1st at 11:00 UTC: 01cd9de119e1231e29b0972a618da6c79fc1f3bd96cee86c93a8068bdc5e4c59, however we got access to this key only after it was already expired. It seems that these keys are the same for all facilities, independent from their geographical location, that is, they vary only with time. This year, our truck driver Alisson, undercover in the Club’s fleet, was able to intercept the shipment of one of these locks to a warehouse which is currently under construction. Quickly, he drafted a block diagram of the lock’s circuit and generated a dump of the flash memory (N25Q032A), both contained in the file which we are providing to you. A few minutes after sending this information through 3G using his Samsung Note Edge™ smartphone, Alisson suffered a tragic transit accident, which means the Club has probably discovered our plans, so that we have only 48h before they change all of their electronic lock scheme. Our teams are ready to deploy next to 3 facilities of critical importance to the Club. They only need that you send a key valid for the current minute to the address https://door.pwn2win.party/KEY.
Category: Web Points: 100+300 Solves: 1 Description:Our informant John has discovered that the access key for the murder request system changes on every new death carried by the Club. The key is the MD5 of the name of ALL the deads until now, in the order they were inserted in the database, and without including any separator between the names. Find the access key to allow our rebel group to shutdown the system. They use a "Bathing and Grooming" website as a cover: https://welovepets.pwn2win.party. The flag must be entered in the format CTF-BR{MD5-of-ALL-the-names}.Bonus (+300 points): For those who, once they discover the table which contains the names, are able to obtain the MD5 making a maximum of 15 HTTP requests to the website server. Show your complete resolution (including &gt; sourcecode) to a judge in order to prove you needed 15 requests or less.

Contrary to popular belief, in Cryptography, breaking a cipher is not the process of finding plaintext relating to a ciphertext. Breaking a cipher (Cryptanalysis) is the process of finding the Key used to encrypt a data. Once a Key is found, many instances of data can be decrypted. That's why in modern ciphers, even if you know the plaintext (or even select it), you should not be able to find the Key.

Due to economic downturns and lack of resources, Monsters Inc. has decided to scare kids regularly door to door, instead of using their teleport technology. Their office in Touran City has developed an Android app, which is used by the head office to communicate with the monsters (i.e. transmit new assignments to them). Recently, the Touran City Police Department (TCPD) tracked and captured a thief and found a cell phone on him. It seems that the thief had stolen the cell phone from one of the Monsters Inc. employees. A backup of the cell phone is attached.Can you find out whose phone is this?Flag: Full Name of the Monster

EN:Genegal Thompson welcomes you!Let me be extremely brief.Our forensic team have already been investigating"The Great Plantation" project for 2 years.During this long period we knew a lot of interesting things like:1) This is the project of Masons.2) The main target is to take over the world with planting own people into big companies.3) Masons do not trust modern encryption algorithms.4) Masons think their own alphabet will let them to communicate more securely than anything else.Short time ago we have withdrawn the notebook of one of their members.There was one interesting file named "THEPlantation.txt".Surely, it was encrypted. Help us to pull the info out of this!Yours, Gen. TompsonRU:Вас приветствует генерал Томпсон!Буду предельно краток.Наша группа криминалистов расследует дело "О великом внедрении" вот уже 2 года.В течение этого периода нам удалось узнать много интересных вещей:1) Проект внедрения был разработан Масонами2) Главная цель проекта - захватить мир через внедрение "своих" людей во все крупные компании3) Масоны не доверяют современной криптографии4) У Масонов есть свой секретный алфавит, позволяющий им "безопасно" общатьсяНекоторое время назад мы изъяли ноутбук, владелец которого явно имел что-то общее с проектом "Великого внедрения". На жестком диске был один интересный файл - "THEPlantation.txt". Но конечно же, он оказался зашифрованным. Помогите нам вытянуть хоть какую-нибудь информацию!Искренне ваш, генерал Томпсон

Hello,We've been suspecting Swiss Secure Cloud of secretely doing some pretty advanced research in artifical intelligence and this has recently been confirmed by the fact that one of their AIs seems to have escaped from their premises and has gone rogue. We have no idea whether this poses a threat or not and we need you to investigate what is going on.Luckily, we have a spy inside SSC and they were able to intercept some communications over the past week when the breach occured. Maybe you can find some information related to the breach and recover the rogue AI.XNote: All the information you need to solve the 3 parts of this challenge is in the pcap. Once you find the exploit for a given part, you should be able to find the corresponding flag and move on to the next part.

Hey you!Come over and help me, please. We discovered a strange key agreement protocol used on this server: .They send a curve which they use later. But we think the robots are a bit UBER-cautious and do not use the curve's P. So they first exchange their public point with a technique we could not figure out. It looks like they do not need a public key for this step.Afterwards they use another technique to agree on a key which they ultimately use to send some encrypted password.We need this last password to shut down the robo-factory on our way to the Oktoberfest.Oh btw, the robots use AES-ECB for symmetric encryption.
Hey!We need your help. Our agent found some details about a huge conspiracy. Looks like they wanna plant a bomb near the Oktoberfest's main fairground ride. But we have a good chance, to get the defusing-password. That's where you have to jump in. We managed to steal the encrypted password along with a decryption file. Our agent also started to work on it, but one of the robots caught him and now we are left-behind with his infos.He found a collision on the real password but wasn't sure, if he can use that one. But, here is it: “Le1sRI6I” - perhaps you have better luck. He also found out, that the robots only use alphanumeric characters and that the collision is of the same length, than the real password. The last thing he told us is, that the defusing password must contain only printable characters.Hope that helps you! And now hurry!Here is your challenge:

I've got another task for you involving my little language, Prop!It consists of the following expressions (denoted e): Boolean constants, written true and false. Boolean variables, written as any alphabetical string. Implies, written e -&gt; e. Equivalence, written e &lt;-&gt; e. Negation, written !e. And, written e &amp;&amp; e. Or, written e || e.You can also parenthesize any expressions or subexpressions (so, you can write (a || b) &amp;&amp; c). Here's another example program:(a || b) &amp;&amp; c &amp;&amp; d &amp;&amp; (!d || b) || (b -&gt; c) &amp;&amp; (d &lt;-&gt; a)This time, I've determined that the attached program is satisfiable, but I want to know the actual values that make this program satisfiable. Can you find me a satisfying model, please? When you've found one, submit a GET request to our server. Any missing keys are considered false.Here's an example request:This request would treat a and b as true and c and the rest of the variables as false. Thus, it's only necessary to assign the true keys to the value true.

In primaries, it is important to get the most attention. With 12 candidates all sharing the stage, it can be hard to pull in voters. Luckily Mr Trump doesn't have much problem with that, but we have a strategy to secure the vote for good. We have found voters respond very well to name recognition, and which ever candidate is polling the highest. We see a snowball effect if we can tip a few online polls his way, then it will be easier for him to take the real ones, and then eventually the nomination.We were able to dump some of the source code from FOX's new online poll service.

MISSION: You should fix vulnerabilities of the given source code, WITHOUT changing its normal behaviour.RULE0: When an honest user gives a non-malicious (but maybe incorrect) input which does not trigger the vulnerabilities,the output of uploaded fixed code should be the same as before.RULE1: When the attacker gives his/her attack vector, your program should not crash or do dangerous actions (explained below),but continue its execution and exit normally at the end. In this situation, your program is allowed to output anything.RULE2: A (poorly-tested) source code may crash even when interacting with a normal user. You should fix these cases too.(NOTE: the output should be correct in this case)Dangerous actions (stated above) includes buffer overflows, writing to unallocated memory address, reading uninitialized memory,and any other programming mistakes leading to crash/instability.Some prevention techniques, detect the attack and prevent memory corruption but throw an exception which terminates the program,leading to denial of service. You should avoid such termination and the program should recover from the attack, continue execution,and exit normally at the end.

Mr. Huxley has been suspected for every cybercrime we have a law for. LEA agents seized his laptop and made a copy of its RAM while the machine was still active. However, Huxley had hidden inside its laptop an EMP device that was triggered while the agents were trying to seize the hard drive. The drive got destroyed, nothing useful has been found from the RAM dump. Getting at least Huxley's passwords would be very helpful to the agents.The challenge is available at Solves: 6

One evening, you decide to take a look at the website of Awesome Corp., a competitor which you suspect of reverse-engineering parts of your software and using these code pieces in their own product. Unfortunately, you got no proof, so you begin to investigate on your own. Soon enough (insert random webhacking stuff here), you get access to an administrators inbox. It seems like they use a custom authentication system which manages access to internal resources like SVN servers and such. It is called ‘Secured Range’ and is in use since January 2011, as the logs state. All you manage to retrieve before an administrator throws you out of the system are two binaries of their login system: The first seems to update masterkeys every few months, the latter produces authentication tokens for the employees. Try to get hold of the system’s current master key to solve this challenge.

Some robots are on the Oktoberfest and want to take some tasty oil in a tent. But they hadn't reserved a table and all tents are full. No one gets access. They found a back entrance and managed to spy the credentials while an employee enters. They captured the username “admin” and password “supersafepw”. But the employee also entered a strange number (168335). As they were sure nobody's looking, they tried the captured data to get in the tent, but it didn't work. Help the robots to get their tasty tasty oil. (Or they have to build their own tent with blackjack and hookers)Here is your challenge: 
Some secret communication was captured, and we’re having trouble decrypting it. Can you help?
Some students who like complaining too much set up a petition platform in order to solve their problems. Unfortunately it is abused to avoid learning and to get teachers fired. Now a teacher who was removed from the school without a solid reason (the students just didn't like the subjects he taught) is seeking for revenge and asked you for help. He already found the platform the students have used to get rid of him. Petition Builder

To be frank, the impact partying robots had on the Oktoberfest in the recent years was disastrous. While the authorities have been able to downplay all recent incidents in the press (which habitually tends to blame visitors from the U.S., Australia, Cologne, and other places, where proper beer can only be found by the initiated), they can no longer deny the problem. Several public safety and law enforcement agencies have joined forces to spoil the robot's fun. They have planned a massive crackdown on our fun-seeking robotic friends. Time and location are currently being communicated together with a passphrase. Our organization, Robots on Rampage (RoR), is determined to stop them from stopping our annual beer-tasting event.A robot agent on location in Munich has dectected a transmission between timestamp 2013-10-19-20:21:42 and 2013-10-19-20:21:43. The precise beginning of the transmission is unknown. The agent was unable to decrypt the message content. Being not the smartest agent, he also disposed of the message capture. In the following we were able to determine the sender location and the Forensic Analysis Robot Team (FART) was able to retrieve the session key and a initialization vector (IV). Judging from the memory fragments FART found, our best guess is that OpenSSL's AES implementation was used in one of the better modes to encrypt the communication. As the session key length is 128bit, the long term key is most probably longer. Due to time constraints we strongly advise against trying to break it. We have less confidence in the humans' ability to design proper communication protocols and services, though. However, we need a human to attack their logic.We have no way to actively communicate with the server the use for coordination. However, we can give you access to one of the lawful interception wiretaps those humans build into all their equipment. A TCP connection to , but we have no idea what he does with the input, except that there is encrypted traffic.

Touran city is nicely organized (download the map below). All streets are either horizontal or vertical and homes are packed in 2x2 blocks. The bottom-left corner of the city is located at 55.6790078, 34.4017202! People of Touran use a simple and straight forward addressing scheme. In the city, the horizontal streets (each having a width of 20 meters) are numbered from 1 to 51 starting from the bottom to the top of the map. The lowest street, which does not have any home at the south, is street number 1. Buildings in each row, where each occupy a 30x30 meter area, are numbered from 1 to 100, left to right. Each building is addressed based on three parameters: the street number, the direction (S for the South and N for the North of street) and building number. For example a sample home, which is indicated by color red in the attached map, is located at 16-N-5, which means the 16th street from bottom, 5th home from left, at the North of the street!Now, what is the Monsters Inc. office address?Flag: the address

It consists of the following expressions (denoted e): Boolean constants, written true and false. Boolean variables, written as any alphabetical string. Implies, written e -&gt; e. Equivalence, written e &lt;-&gt; e. Negation, written !e. And, written e &amp;&amp; e. Or, written e || e.You can also parenthesize any expressions or subexpressions (so, you can write (a || b) &amp;&amp; c). Here's another example program:(a || b) &amp;&amp; c &amp;&amp; d &amp;&amp; (!d || b) || (b -&gt; c) &amp;&amp; (d &lt;-&gt; a)So, what I'd like from you is for you to calculate the conjunctive normal form (CNF) of the attached program.

We are trying to study the Black Holes. One of the most controversial theory related to Black Holes is the "Information Loss Paradox". Calculations suggest that physical information could permanently disappear in a black hole. But this violates the quantum theory.

Our CEO decided to hire someone less greedy to help us redesign Blobfish. But he must first prove he is worthy. Look at the log, and the cipher design. If you can find the master key, use the function `make_flag()` on it to generate the flag. Send us the flag, and we'll get back to you for further negotiations.

We had an intensive intelligence operation on the enemy radio. We know that they use LPCM with a sample rate of 16 kHz and 16 bits per sample (little endian). Also an LFSR is used for scrambling, with 16 bits or 32 bits of state.There is an eavesdropping attached. Our agents are sure that it began with saying "The flag is", then, there is a delay for one or two seconds, and finally, the flag is said. Hint: When the radio is supposedly silent, it actually includes a small amount of noise. Try brute forcing the noise values. These values are usually small, e.g., in the set {-8, ..., +8}.
We have a brand new encryption tool to replace old, insecure encryption tools. Featuring PBKDF and AES-128-CBC, it's the best tool on the market for securing data - .
We have a set of N friends, and M pairwise connections between friends. Each connection goes both ways, so if, for example, Aariss Weiron is friends with Bendelman, then Bendelman is also friends with Aariss Weiron. Each connection also has an associated weight, representing how close the two friends are, which is a positive integer value. No two pairs of friends with a connection have the same weight.Our objective is to somehow divide our set of friends into two 'equal' halves. We also want to put friends who are pretty close to each other into the same set. We formally define the problem as follows:We have a set of friends of even size, some with bi-directional pairwise connections. Each connection has a positive integer weight, and each connection has a distinct weight. Our objective is to divide our friends into two sets of equal size with this property: The largest connection-weight that crosses between the two sets should be as small as possible. Compute this connection-weight for each friend network given. A crossing connection is one such that the two friends it connects are in different sets. Each friend network is in the following format: The first line has two numbers:N (guaranteed to be even) and M (number of connections). M lines follow this line. Each one represents a connection and has three tokens. The first two are the friends it connects, and the last one is the weight of the connection.

Welcome to MATRIX
Welcome to Verticode, the new method of translating text into vertical codes.Each verticode has two parts: the color shift and the code.The code takes the inputted character and translates it into an ASCII code, and then into binary, then puts that into an image in which each black pixel represents a 1 and each white pixel represents a 0.For example, A is 65 which is 1000001 in binary, B is 66 which is 1000010, and C is 67 which is 1000011, so the corresponding verticode would look like this.Except, it isn't that simple.A color shift is also integrated, which means that the color before each verticode shifts the ASCII code, by adding the number that the color corresponds to, before translating it into binary. In that case, the previous verticode could also look like <a>this</a>.The table for the color codes is:0 = Red1 = Purple2 = Blue3 = Green4 = Yellow5 = OrangeThis means that a red color shift for the letter A, which is 65 + 0 = 65, would translate into 1000001 in binary; however, a green color shift for the letter A, which is 65 + 3 = 68, would translate into 1000100 in binary.Given this , read the verticode into text and find the flag.Note that the flag will not be in the typical sctf{flag} format, but will be painfully obvious text. Once you find this text, you will submit it in the sctf{text} format. So, if the text you find is adunnaisawesome, you will submit it as sctf{adunnaisawesome}.

You are given a download for an old dos game called "Tony and Friends", you extract it and open it in dosbox and load into the game. The clue for this was that any more than 64 sprites on screen at any given time will crash the game. If you pay normally you will be unable to progress legitimately because there are literally so many enemies you'd just die, instead I used CheatEngine and found the 2byte code that was my health, then set it to 9999, I then found the 2 byte code that turned on and off the "super milk" powerup (basically a mario star) and set it to FFFF to kill all enemies on contact. Just by doing this you can make it through 19/21 levels, for 3 the doors that let you progress are broken (stages 2-3 and 3-1) in order to get past them I used the game's weird timeout feature to my advantage. When time runs out the game pushes you out of the map and kills you, so I found the 2 byte code for the timer and set it to 2-3 seconds, then had the cheatengine pause button pulled up, when my character phased through the walls in to the space betweem 2 rooms I would pause the game and set time back to 9999, I could then freely move between rooms in the game without having to use the doors.Every stage had 1 character for the flag next to the end of the level, so 1-1 was H written in coins, 1-2 was X written in coins, 1-3 was P written in coins, and so on.The final flag was: hxp{E4620CCC29475F11}Sorry i didn't add any pictures, I already deleted everything by the time I though about making a writeupp.s: I did not say the exact memory locations for health and time and such because the location of them changed each time I restarted dosbox. To find them I would go into the tutorial world, search for a hex value of 000C (12) with cheat enginge which is the number of starting health you get. intentionally take 3 hearts of dmg (3 hearts = 6 health) and then look through the list for values that were 000C when I first looked but are now 0006. There would be 2 values, one was the health value and the other was the sprites for the health, just set the health value up and the sprites follow. p.s.s: To find the time and milk powerup I went to the memory location of the health and for time looked for a value changing down by 1 every second ( found up a little, very easy to spot) and for the milk looked for what values changed when I picked up the milk and it wore off (hard to spot at first, but once you know you're looking for  0000 --&gt; FFFF it becomes much easier.

Zombies do not only tend to eat brains, they also tend to write unsecure code! Looks like they don't even know how to use stringcopy functions correctly, so there should be no problem for you to exploit this most simple of all bugs, right?SSH: PORT: 2091USER: ctfPASS: xxx
Zombies love brains. But zombies forget, so they have a tool where they can enter the location of brains they found. In a heroic mission someone managed to obtain both the source code and the information that a critical file can be found at '/var/www/flag'. Your mission is to obtain the contents of this file by any means and avenge your fallen friend!Service:

[EN]Surfing in the Shallowweb, we have discovered a new algorithm that promises to be the newest substituition cipher. The algorithm to encrypt works as following: the user informs the text to be encrypted and a number N. Initially, the algorithm shift all letters one position to the right (e.g. 'A' tuns into 'B'). With this result, in the next step, the algorithm now shift the text two positions to the right. And with the text from the previous output, it repeats the shift procedure until N. Your task is quite simple: given an encrypted flag and an N number, discover the flag.Encrypted flag: 3RG{hv1g_f0h_1g_b0h_g0_V0h} N: 11[PT-BR]Pesquisando na shallowweb, descobrimos um novo algoritmo que promete ser a mais nova cifra de substituicao. O algoritmo para cifrar funciona da seguinte forma: o usuraio informa o texto a ser cifrado e um numero N. O algoritmo, inicialmente, desloca todas as letras em uma posicao a direita ('A', por exemplo, vira 'B). Com o texto da saida, no passo seguinte, o algoritmo desloca esse novo texto duas posicoes a direita. E com o texto da saida anterior, ele repete o procedimento de deslocamentos ate o numero N. Sua tarefa bem simples: dado a flag cifrada e um numero N, descubra a flag.Flag cifrada: 3RG{hv1g_f0h_1g_b0h_g0_V0h}N: 11

fsociety has launched another attack at Evil Corp. However, Evil Corp has decided to encrypt the .dat file with a CBC cipher. Reports reveal that it is not AES and the key is relatively simple, but the IV might be long. And remember, fsociety and evilcorp are closely linked.Hint! Snakes serve the fsociety. Hmmm.Hint! fsociety and evilcorp are too close, even 16 characters long together. DamnFsociety_new.dat

h4x0r is fed up with all your attacks on his castle and has decided to retaliate by attacking us back. He sent us a mail with this image as a warning. Hope you can figure out his warning message:-<img src="http://backdoor-problems.cognizance.org.in/forensic250/bbb.png">MD5 of the message is the answer.
h4x0r realized that his software had a vulnerability and has fixed the software now. After using it free for so much time, no one wants to buy it. Just get us the key again. You can find the software Get cracking!
h4x0r, after 10e^46578398239 blinks of the cursor on his windows 98 machine, managed to create something worth selling.    Now, you would expect him to open source it but then how will he upgrade his Castle? Now you and I don't buy softwares do we? And this "Enter the Registration Key" prompt makes you and I want to tear your hairs apart. Your job is to get that #$&amp;%$##@ key. This should be easy for us but we want you to    have the fun. You can find the software Get cracking!

here is useful tool for hackers!
here's some data exfiltration going on in . Can you figure you what happened?
hey, we've got a problem here, there's a secret data in some smart card but we couldn't access to it. It's so important to us. data.bin is the dumped card's data. also we have a binary file scardprovider which we took in some way(believe me you don't want to know how). It seems to be the main part but we couldn't run it. Could you please take a look at ?

nerd safe houseThis zombie apocalypse is a tough thing. Dozens of zombies are following you and looking forward to have a nice snack, when some fat guy appears. You outrun him easily, so eating all of him will keep the zombies busy - for a while. So after you keep running a few blocks, you find a safe house. As you stand there panting, sweating and sighing at their door you notice: "Hey, I probably sound just like a zombie." And this is where the automatic defense system kicks in. A big, laser-zoom explosion-looming automatic spring gun locks in on you. Nice. That's what you get for leaving a fat person behind. All your yelling "Help, help. I'm human and... and I have weapons" (a lie), remains unheard. When finally somebody responds on the intercom: "Oh are you? This safe house is for nerds only! Show us how smart you are and find the missing token." So there you go. Try solving the annoying puzzle at or zombies will eat your soul!
